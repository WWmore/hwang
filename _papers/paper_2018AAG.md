We propose a specific customization of Dropout, called \textit{Sensor Dropout}, to improve multisensory policy robustness and handle partial failure in the sensor-set. We also introduce an additional auxiliary loss on the policy network in order to reduce jerks during policy switching triggered by an abrupt sensor failure or deactivation/activation. Through the visualization of gradients, we show that the learned policies are conditioned on the same latent states representation despite having diverse observations spaces.
