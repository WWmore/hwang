I am a first-year Robotics PhD student in Georgia Institute of Technology, supervised under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="\_blank">Professor Evangelos Theodorou</a> in <a href="http://pwp.gatech.edu/acds/" target="\_blank">Autonomous Control and Decision Systems Laboratory</a>. 

<!-- My research interest lies broadly under <b>Robot Learning and Control</b>. Specifically, I have researched on Deep (Inverse) Reinforcement Learning, Stochastic Optimal Control, and combing XXX -->

Before joining Georgia Tech, I finished my M.S. in Robotics at 
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="\_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I was supervised under 
<a href="http://ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/george-a-kantor/" target="\_blank">Mr. George Kantor</a>
, while receiving valuable advices from 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/" target="\_blank">Prof. Manuela Veloso</a>
 and 
<a href="https://devinschwab.com/" target="\_blank">Devin Schwab</a>. 
I also owned a B.S. in MechE at 
<a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html" target="\_blank">National Taiwan University</a>
, with a one-year research exchange at
<a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/" target="\_blank">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>.
<!-- My research here relates to off-road autonomous navigation for all-terrain vehicle application. Specifically, I worked on deep reinforcement learning, deep imitation learning, and model-predictive planning as my master thesis.  -->

I am very fortunate to work in 
<a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="\_blank">Uber Advanced Technology Group (ATG)</a> as a Robotics Autonomy/Software Engineer from Sep. 2017 to Dec. 2018, developing algorithms of motion planning and trajectory optimization for self-driving vehicles.
