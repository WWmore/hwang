I am a first-year Robotics PhD student excited to announce that I will be joining Georgia Institute of Technology as  starting from Spring 2019. I will be working in <a href="http://pwp.gatech.edu/acds/" target="\_blank">Autonomous Control and Decision Systems Lab</a>, leading by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="\_blank">Prof. Evangelos Theodorou</a>. Currently, I am actively looking for research intern and visiting opportunities until Sep 2019. 

<!-- My research interest lies broadly under <b>Robot Learning and Control</b>. Specifically, I have researched on Deep (Inverse) Reinforcement Learning, Stochastic Optimal Control, and combing XXX -->

Before joining GaTech, I finished my Master degree at 
<a href="http://ri.cmu.edu/" target="\_blank">Robotics Institute</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="\_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, supervised under 
<a href="http://ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/george-a-kantor/" target="\_blank">Mr. George Kantor</a>
with valuable advices from 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/" target="\_blank">Prof. Manuela Veloso</a>
 and 
<a href="https://devinschwab.com/" target="\_blank">Devin Schwab</a>. 
I also owned a bachelor degree in MechE at National Taiwan University, with a one-year research exchange at 
Tokyo Institute of Technology.
<!-- My research here relates to off-road autonomous navigation for all-terrain vehicle application. Specifically, I worked on deep reinforcement learning, deep imitation learning, and model-predictive planning as my master thesis.  -->

I also worked in 
<a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/" target="\_blank">Uber Advanced Technology Group (ATG)</a>, as a Robotics Autonomy/Software Engineer from Sep. 2017 to Dec. 2018, developing algorithms of motion planning and trajectory optimization for self-driving vehicles.
